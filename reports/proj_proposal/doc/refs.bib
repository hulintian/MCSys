abstract = {Quantifying drivers’ perceived risk is important in the design and evaluation of the behaviour of automated vehicles (AVs) and in predicting takeovers by the driver. A ‘Driver’s Risk Field’ (DRF) function has been previously shown to be able to predict manual driving behaviour in several simulated scenarios. In this paper, we tested if the DRF-based risk estimate (rˆ) could predict manual driving behaviour and the driver’s perceived risk during automated driving. To ensure that the participants perceived realistic levels of risk, the experiment was conducted in a test vehicle. Eight participants drove five laps manually and experienced 12 different laps of automated driving on a test track. The test track consisted of three sections (which were sub-divided into 12 sectors): curve driving (9 sectors), parked car (1 sector), and 90-degree intersections (2 sectors). If the driver verbally expressed risk or performed a takeover, that particular sector was labelled as risky. The results show that the DRF risk estimate (rˆ) predicted manual driving behaviour (ρsteering=0.69, ρspeed=0.64), as well as correlated with the driver’s perceived risk in curve driving (r2 = 0.98) and while negotiating a car parked outside the lane boundary (r2=0.59). In conclusion, the DRF-based risk estimate (rˆ) is predictive of manual driving behaviour and perceived risk in automated driving. Future research should include tactical and strategic components to the driving task.}

    abstract = { Autonomous obstacle avoidance and decision-making algorithms for intelligent connected vehicles in a complicated transportation environment are important studies on intelligent driving. However, it is difficult to adapt to a more complicated traffic environment based on safety distance and conventional potential field. Therefore, in this paper, a driving risk field model based on field theory is proposed involving transportation factors and vehicle conditions. A hidden Markov model was used to evaluate and determine the motion state of surrounding vehicles. A safe, feasible, and smooth collision-free path was planned by calculating the magnitude of the potential field forces on the longitudinal and lateral sides of the obstacle vehicles. The results showed that the method can effectively select a suitable path for obstacle avoidance in complex road conditions while satisfying safety and traffic laws. }

abstract = {Driving risk prediction is important for the development of intelligent vehicles (IVs), and the rise of human-like driving requires a driving risk prediction system to match the subjective risk cognitive characteristics of human drivers. In this study, a subjective driving risk prediction model (SDRPM) for IVs is proposed and applied to lane-changing (LC) conditions. We regard the cognitive risk of the human driver as the coupling result of environmental objective risk and driver subjective cognition at the spatial and temporal scales. Then, an objective anisotropic risk field was built to describe risks in traffic environments, and a subjective spatiotemporal cognition field to describe the cognitive characteristics of human drivers. By combining the two fields, the spatiotemporal distribution features of the human driver’s cognitive risk were obtained and used as model inputs, and SDRPM output the predicted subjective driving risk level (SDRL) of the human driver. To quantify the SDRLs, six participants were recruited to watch 1,213 driving videos and report the SDRLs they cognized. Participants were provided with 360-degree driving video around the test vehicle and virtual reality glasses to ensure the reliability of the obtained SDRLs. Verification results showed that SDRPM has good predicted accuracy and long advance predicted time, with 97.53\% predicted accuracy, which can reach 95.06\% at 2 s before the LC point. Compared with six state-of-the-art models, SDRPM can improve the predicted accuracy while reducing the dimensions of input features. In summary, SDRPM can ensure the driving safety, and improve user acceptance and trust in IVs.},

abstract = {Proximity-based interaction through a long cane is essential for the blind and the visually impaired. We designed and implemented an obstacle detector consisting of a 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF) camera and a planar tactile display to extend the interaction range and provide rich non-visual information about the environment. Users choose a better path after acquiring the spatial layout of obstacles than with a white cane alone. A user study with 6 blind people was analyzed and showed extra time is needed to ensure safe walking while reading the layout. Both hanging and ground-based obstacles were circumvented. Tactile mapping information has been designed for representation of precise spatial information around a blind user.},
